## Overview

The **Lunar Open-source Rover Standard (LORS)** aims to create a shared framework for designing, building, and operating lunar rovers, similar to how CubeSat standards unified satellite development. 

Currently, every team builds rovers differently, leading to wasted resources and fragmented innovation. 

LORS addresses this by establishing open standards that enable interoperability, reduce development costs, and accelerate lunar exploration.

## Problem

Every lunar rover team reinvents the wheel, using different communication systems, designs, and data formats. This results in:

- **Wasted resources**: Teams rebuild the same components repeatedly
- **Fragmented innovation**: Rovers cannot easily work together or share data
- **Slow progress**: Small teams (universities, startups, makers) lack reusable templates
- **Inefficient lunar economy**: Similar to satellites before CubeSat standards

## Benefits

### For the Space Sector
- Democratizes lunar exploration for citizens, students, and startups
- Reduces costs by eliminating redundant design cycles
- Accelerates innovation through cross-compatibility
- Builds foundation for sustainable, interoperable lunar economy

## Getting Involved

LORS is an open initiative. Ways to contribute:

- **Feedback on Research**: Review draft reports and provide input
- **Stakeholder Introductions**: Connect with lunar rover teams or delivery providers
- **Technical Expertise**: Share knowledge on rover standards or lunar operations
- **Community Outreach**: Help spread awareness of LORS

### How to Contribute

If you want to contribute, we suggest following this workflow. We've defined the tools and steps to help everyone work together effectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DO NOT COMMIT PURE AI-GENERATED TEXT!**
> It is easy to generate meaningless pages of text with AI that are hard to read. Please ensure your contributions are valuable, concise, and reviewed by a human.

1.  **Work in an AI-Native Way**: Ensure all documentation is accessible to AI tools. This means keeping data structured and using scripts to download information, so AI assistants can help us build faster.
2.  **Install Git**: Install `git` on your computer. This is the standard tool we use to track changes and collaborate on files.
3.  **Setup Secure Access (SSH)**: Configure git to securely connect to remote repositories (GitHub) using an SSH key. This acts like a secure digital key for your computer.
4.  **Use AI-Assisted Editors (Optional)**: We recommend using modern text editors that support AI features to speed up your work. Examples include VSCode (with plugins like Cline or Copilot), Cursor, or Antigravity.
5.  **Visualize Changes (Optional)**: Use tools like the [Git Graph Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph). This helps you "see" the history of changes and how different versions relate to each other.
6.  **Create Your Copy (Fork)**: "Fork" this repository on GitHub. This creates your own personal copy of the project where you can freely make changes without affecting the main project immediately.
7.  **Download to Your Computer (Clone)**: "Clone" your forked copy to your local machine. This downloads the files so you can edit them directly on your computer.
8.  **Save and Upload Changes (Commit & Push)**: "Commit" your edits (save a snapshot of your changes) and "Push" them (upload) back to your online copy (your fork).
9.  **Propose Your Changes (Pull Request)**: Create a "Pull Request" from your forked repository to this original one. This allows us to review your work and merge it into the official project.
