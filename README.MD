# Lunar Open-source Rover Standard (LORS)

## Overview

The **Lunar Open-source Rover Standard (LORS)** aims to create a shared framework for designing, building, and operating lunar rovers, similar to how CubeSat standards unified satellite development. 

Currently, every team builds rovers differently, leading to wasted resources and fragmented innovation. 

LORS addresses this by establishing open standards that enable interoperability, reduce development costs, and accelerate lunar exploration.

## Problem

Every lunar rover team reinvents the wheel, using different communication systems, designs, and data formats. This results in:

- **Wasted resources**: Teams rebuild the same components repeatedly
- **Fragmented innovation**: Rovers cannot easily work together or share data
- **Slow progress**: Small teams (universities, startups, makers) lack reusable templates
- **Inefficient lunar economy**: Similar to satellites before CubeSat standards

## Benefits

### For the Space Sector
- Democratizes lunar exploration for citizens, students, and startups
- Reduces costs by eliminating redundant design cycles
- Accelerates innovation through cross-compatibility
- Builds foundation for sustainable, interoperable lunar economy

## Getting Involved

LORS is an open initiative. Ways to contribute:

- **Feedback on Research**: Review draft reports and provide input
- **Stakeholder Introductions**: Connect with lunar rover teams or delivery providers
- **Technical Expertise**: Share knowledge on rover standards or lunar operations
- **Community Outreach**: Help spread awareness of LORS
