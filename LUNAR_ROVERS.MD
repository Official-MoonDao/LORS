# Lunar Rovers Registry

## TL;DR
Lunar rovers are evolving from government-led science platforms to a diverse ecosystem of commercial utilities, micro-prospectors, and crewed vehicles. The registry is now divided into specific categories:
*   **Utility & Multi-Purpose:** Heavy-duty workhorses like Astrolab FLEX and VIPER.
*   **Micro & Nano:** Small, cost-effective platforms like MAPP and Yaoki, including "CubeSat-class" rovers.
*   **Crewed (LTV):** Vehicles designed for astronauts, like the Lunar Dawn LTV.
*   **Research & Special:** Unique locomotion concepts (walking, swarming) like Asagumo and Colmena.
