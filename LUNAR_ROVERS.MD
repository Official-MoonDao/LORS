## Crewed Lunar Rovers & LTV Candidates

Crewed rovers are unpressurized vehicles designed to transport astronauts on the lunar surface, as opposed to autonomous robotic rovers. NASA's **Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV)** services contract is being competed for by three primary teams to support Artemis astronauts.

**Why "Crewed" matters:** The distinction is operational—these rovers require human-machine interfaces, crew safety systems, and EVA suit compatibility, not just larger size.

1.  **Lunar Outpost** - "Lunar Dawn" Team (LTV Name: Eagle) (Partners: Lockheed Martin, MDA Space, GM, Goodyear)
2.  **Venturi Astrolab** - "FLEX" LTV (Team: Axiom Space, Odyssey Space Research)
3.  **Intuitive Machines** - "Moon RACER" (Team: AVL, Boeing, Michelin, Northrop Grumman)
