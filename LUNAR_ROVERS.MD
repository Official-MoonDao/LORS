## Small Lunar Rovers & Micro-Rovers

Small lunar rovers (<10 kg) are a growing field in lunar exploration, often focusing on swarm capabilities and low-cost deployment.

| Rover | Developer | Size / Weight | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CADRE** | NASA JPL | ~Size of carry-on bag | **Autonomous Swarm**. Trio of rovers for cooperative mapping. |
| **Lunar Zebro** | TU Delft | A4 sheet size, 2.5 kg | **Walking Rover**. 6 C-shaped legs for difficult terrain. |
| **Sora-Q (LEV-2)** | JAXA / Tomy | 8 cm diameter, 250 g | **Transformable**. Sphere to rover. Deployed by SLIM (2024). |
| **Iris (CubeRover)** | Carnegie Mellon | Shoebox size, 2 kg | **Standardized**. CubeSat-style rover standards. |
| **Colmena** | UNAM (Mexico) | <1 inch tall, <60 g | **Micro-swarm**. 5 tiny robots studying lunar dust. |
| **Yaoki** | Dymon | 15x15 cm, 0.5 kg | **All-Terrain**. Two-wheeled, durable. |

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Mass:** Typically under 10 kg.
- **Locomotion:** Often 4-wheel skid-steer or novel types (legs, shape-shifting).
- **Autonomy:** Heavy reliance on autonomy due to communication latency and swarm operations.
