# Lunar Landers Registry

## TL;DR
The lunar lander market is rapidly shifting towards commercial providers (CLPS) offering regular "delivery services" to the lunar surface. The registry tracks these vehicles, focusing on payload capacity and power availability.
*   **Light/Micro (<100kg):** Z-01, MX-1, Peregrine.
*   **Utility/Medium (100kg-500kg):** Nova-C, Blue Ghost, APEX 1.0, ispace Series 3, B5.
*   **Heavy/Logistics (>500kg):** Griffin, Nova-D, Blue Moon MK1, Argonaut, Starship.

## The CLPS Program
The Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative is the primary driver of the commercial lander market. 
*   **Program Value:** Cumulative maximum contract value of **$2.6 billion** through 2028.
*   **Eligible Vendors:** Currently **13 U.S. companies** are eligible to bid on delivery task orders (Task Orders / TO).
*   **Mission Model:** NASA is a "primary customer" but buys services, meaning the vendors remain responsible for payload integration, launch, and landing operations.
