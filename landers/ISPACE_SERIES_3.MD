# ispace Series 3

## Overview
The ispace Series 3 lander is the successor to the Series 1 (HAKUTO-R) and Series 2 (APEX 1.0) architectures. It is designed for increased payload capacity and enhanced mission flexibility, targeting launch missions starting in 2027.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Scale:** Standing 3.6 meters tall, the Series 3 significantly increases the internal volume for customer payloads compared to the HAKUTO-R lander.
*   **Payload Capacity:** Designed to deliver up to **500 kg** of cargo to the lunar surface.
*   **Heritage:** Built upon the flight heritage of Mission 1 and the high-reliability design of the APEX 1.0 (SERIES-2).

## Communication Systems
*   **Enhanced Bandwidth:** Utilizes dual X-Band and S-Band architectures for high-rate telemetry and independent payload data routing.
*   **Autonomous Navigation:** Incorporates advanced sensors for high-precision landing in complex terrain (Successor to SLIM-derived technologies used in APEX).

## Missions
*   **ispace Mission 4:** Planned to debut the Series 3 lander (Target 2027).

## LORS Relevance
*   **Medium-Class Standard:** The Series 3 fills the gap between micro-landers (Series 1) and heavy-lift platforms, providing a baseline for medium-duty rover egress systems.
