# Ceres-1 / B5

## Overview
Ceres Robotics is developing the B5 (Ceres-1) lander to provide a 500kg-class delivery service to the lunar surface. The company focuses on integrated power systems and long-duration lunar surface operation.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Scale:** Utility-class lander capable of delivering substantial payloads or small rovers.
*   **Power Integration:** Designed to interface with the "MoonPower Lunar Grid" (C-Tower solar arrays) for sustained operations through the lunar night.

## LORS Relevance
*   **Infrastructure Bridge:** Ceres-1 represents a transition toward "Power-as-a-Service" landers, which is a key requirement for the LORS roadmap regarding sustained surface stay.
