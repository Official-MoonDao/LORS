# Masten XL-1

## Overview
The Masten XL-1 was a light-class lunar lander developed for NASA's CLPS program. Although Masten Space Systems filed for bankruptcy in 2022 and its assets were acquired by Astrobotic, the XL-1 design represents a key technical benchmark for precision landing and vertical take-off/landing (VTOL) lunar systems.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Precision Landing:** Designed for high-accuracy landing utilizing Masten's vertically integrated propulsion expertise.
*   **Payload Support:** Engineered to support up to 100 kg of cargo with a standard 28VDC electrical bus and serial data interfaces.

## LORS Relevance
*   **Technical Heritage:** Many of the precision landing algorithms and propulsion benchmarks from the XL-1 project have been integrated into the broader CLPS ecosystem.
*   **Standardization:** The 28VDC / RS-422 interface pattern used by XL-1 remains a core baseline for LORS micro-rover compatibility.
