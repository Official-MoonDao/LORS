# Orbit Beyond Z-01

## Overview
The Z-01 is a micro-lander developed by Orbit Beyond, leveraging technology heritage from Team Indus. It was designed for rapid, low-cost delivery of small instruments and rovers to the lunar surface.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Compact Design:** With a dry mass of only 210 kg, it is one of the lightest lander designs in the CLPS pool.
*   **Rover Support:** Specifically optimized for deploying micro-rovers like the ECA (Team Indus) or other nano-class assets.

## LORS Relevance
*   **Nano-Gateway:** The Z-01 architecture provides a baseline for "Class C" (Nano/Swarm) rover interfaces, prioritizing low power consumption and high integration.
