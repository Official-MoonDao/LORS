# Nova-D

## Overview
Nova-D is the heavy-cargo variant of Intuitive Machines' lander family. It is designed to deliver large-scale infrastructure, including Lunar Terrain Vehicles (LTVs), fission surface power systems, and heavy rovers to the Moon.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Scale:** Significantly larger than Nova-C, optimized for heavy lift vehicles like Falcon Heavy or Starship.
*   **Massive Capacity:** Capable of delivering up to **2,500 kg** to the lunar surface.
*   **Modular Deck:** Features a wide, stable deck for deploying large mobile assets or static infrastructure.

## Communication Systems
*   **LDN Integration:** Operates within the Intuitive Machines **Lunar Data Network (LDN)**, providing high-speed data relay and line-of-sight communications for surface assets.
*   **Bandwidth:** Supports high-rate S-Band and Ka-Band links for complex scientific missions and real-time operations.

## LORS Relevance
*   **Heavy Mobility Hub:** Nova-D is the primary delivery vehicle for next-generation pressurized and unpressurized rovers (like Moon RACER), defining the mechanical egress and power interfaces for heavy-lift LORS assets.
