# Moon Express MX-1

## Overview
The Moon Express MX-1 is a compact, robotic lunar lander designed for cost-effective payload delivery. It is the first in a family of scalable spacecraft intended to explore and harvest lunar resources.

## Technical Architecture
*   **Scale:** Roughly the size of a large coffee table, the MX-1 is designed to reach the lunar surface from a geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO).
*   **Propulsion:** Utilizes a high-test hydrogen peroxide (HTP) monopropellant system for descent and landing thrusters.
*   **Unique Landing:** Notably designed without traditional landing legs, instead utilizing collapsible fuel tanks to cushion the final touchdown.

## LORS Relevance
*   **Low-Barrier Entry:** The MX-1 architecture lowers the cost-to-entry for universities and small research groups to place 30kg-class payloads on the Moon, making it a key vehicle for "LORS Experimental" class missions.
