# EagleCam

## Overview
EagleCam is a CubeSat-sized camera payload developed by students at ERAU. It launched on IM-1 (Odysseus).

## Key Features
*   **Concept:** Designed to be ejected *before* landing to film the lander's touchdown from a third-person perspective.
*   **Result:** Deployment failed during descent due to nav issues, but it was deployed later on the surface (static).
*   **Comms:** Uses Wi-Fi to send images back to the lander.
