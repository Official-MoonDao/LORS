# MAPP

## Overview
The Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform (MAPP) is a commercial micro-rover developed by Lunar Outpost. It effectively created the commercial standard for "CubeSat-class" rovers.

## Key Features
*   **Comms:** First rover to utilize the LTE/4G lunar network (IM-2 Mission).
*   **Cost:** Low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) philosophy.
*   **Mission:** Demonstrating resource prospecting and commercial payload hosting.

## LORS Relevance
*   **Standard interface:** The payload deck is a prime candidate for the LORS "Micro-Payload" standard.
*   **Data:** Its usage of LTE vs legacy space radio is a key architectural shift LORS must address.
