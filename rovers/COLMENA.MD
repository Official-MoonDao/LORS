# Colmena

## Overview
Colmena ("Hive") was a mission by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). It consisted of five tiny robots, each weighing less than 60 grams.

## Communication Systems
*   **Transit Connectivity:** The central "Beehive" control module (on the lander) successfully established heartbeat signals with the five micro-robots during the Peregrine M1 flight.
*   **Mission Success:** Mexico’s first lunar mission demonstrated that swarm electronics could survive launch and operate in the deep space environment.
