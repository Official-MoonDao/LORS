# HEMIUNU-01

## Overview
HEMIUNU-01 is the first rover prototype developed by **FUTURA**. It is designed for testing in simulated lunar environments to validate core technologies for in-situ construction and mobility.

## Key Features
*   **Thermal Resistance:** Designed to operate in temperatures as low as -50°C.
*   **Independent Drive:** Features independent motors for each wheel to enhance mobility in lunar regolith.
*   **Robotic Interaction:** Equipped with a fully functional robotic arm for interaction with the lunar surface and infrastructure tasks.
*   **Mission Goal:** Serve as a precursor for HEMIUNU-02 and future lunar infrastructure development.

## Development History
*   **September 2025:** Conducted first motion tests.
*   **November 2025:** Prototype presented at Campus Party during TecWeek in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
*   **Regolith Testing:** Ongoing phase (since July 2025) focusing on material behavior and structural integrity for lunar construction.
