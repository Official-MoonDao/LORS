# VIPER

## Overview
The Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) is a lunar rover developed by NASA to explore the south pole of the Moon. It is designed to prospect for lunar resources, specifically water ice, in permanently shadowed regions.

## Key Features
*   **Drill:** 1-meter drill to extract samples from below the surface.
*   **Instruments:** Neutron Spectrometer System (NSS), NIRVSS, MSolo.
*   **Mobility:** Specialized suspension to handle difficult crater terrain and soft regolith.

## LORS Relevance
*   Acts as a reference for "Utility Class" drilling interfaces.
*   Sets benchmarks for thermal survival in Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs).
