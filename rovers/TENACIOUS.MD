# TENACIOUS

## Overview
TENACIOUS is a micro-rover developed by ispace's European subsidiary (Luxembourg). It is flying on the HAKUTO-R Mission 2.

## Communication Systems
TENACIOUS relies on a relay-based architecture:
*   **Surface-to-Lander:** Utilizes an **X-Band** wireless link to the **HAKUTO-R (Resilience)** lander.
*   **Lander-to-Earth:** Commands for the rover are routed from ispace Luxembourg via ESA’s ESTRACK network to the lander.
*   **Performance:** Designed for near real-time video streaming with minimal latency.

## Mobility & Operations
*   **Egress:** Deployed from the Resilience lander's dedicated payload bay.
*   **Speed:** Nominal driving speed of **5-10 cm/s**.
*   **Navigation:** Remotely operated from Luxembourg with HD camera visual feedback.
*   **Mission:** Demonstration of regolith collection (ownership transfer to NASA) and deployment of the "Moonhouse" art project.
