# Yaoki

## Overview
Yaoki is an ultra-compact "nano-rover" developed by Dymon (Japan). It is designed to be extremely lightweight and durable.

## Key Features
*   **Locomotion:** 2-wheel design where the body swings/tumbles.
*   **Durability:** Can survive high drops (shock resistant up to 100G+), meaning it doesn't need a soft deployment ramp—it can just be dropped.
*   **Scale:** Less than 0.5 kg, redefining "microrover".
