# Sora-Q

## Overview
Sora-Q (LEV-2) is a transformable lunar robot developed by JAXA and toy maker Tomy.

## Communication Systems
*   **Layered Relay:** Sora-Q (LEV-2) communicates locally via a 2.4 GHz link to the **LEV-1** hopping robot, which then relays data to Earth.
*   **Lander Handshake:** Designed with compatibility for the HAKUTO-R lander's wireless relay system, though it achieved its primary success via the SLIM mission.

## Mobility & Transformation
*   **Operational Mechanism:** Deploys as a 250g sphere to survive landing impact, then transforms by splitting its shell into two wheels.
*   **Visual Documentation:** Successfully captured and transmitted the "Nose-down" image of the SLIM lander, providing the first external visual confirmation of the landing state.
