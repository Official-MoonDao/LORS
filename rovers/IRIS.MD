# Iris

## Overview
Iris was a nano-rover developed by students at CMU. It launched on the Peregrine Mission 1.

## Communication Systems
*   **Transit Comms:** Successfully communicated with Earth via the **Peregrine** lander's S-Band relay during its 10-day cislunar journey.
*   **Operational Success:** Although the landing failed, Iris was the first American university rover to be powered on and transmit data from space.
