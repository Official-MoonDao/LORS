# **LORS Research Interview**

## **Who & Why?**

## *Who we are:* We are **LunCo**, working within the framework of **LORS project** sponsored by **MoonDAO**. 

## *Why this interview?*

## We are developing the Lunar Open-source Rover Standard (LORS). Think of it like creating the USB or CubeSat standards for lunar rovers. Currently, every team reinvents the wheel for basic things like power connectors, mounting plates, and data protocols. We want to stop that. Your input would help shape an open standard that benefits the entire lunar ecosystem.

## **Our Goal:**

## We are conducting **"Problem Interviews"** to understand the friction you face in rover development. We are *not* selling anything; we are purely gathering data on the biggest friction points teams face during rover development (integration, power, thermal, etc.) to ensure our standard solves real problems. We want to know where you lose time, money, and sleep, so we can design a standard that solves those specific problems. 

## **The Procedure: What to Expect**

## *We know technical interviews can often feel like interrogations. This is not that.*

* ## **Format:** A casual **20-30 minute** conversation.

* ## **Your Role:** You are the expert. We are the students.

* ## **Confidentiality:** We do **NOT** want your "secret sauce" or proprietary technology. We focus on the *interfaces*—the "boring" connection points between components.

* ## **No Wrong Answers:** If a question doesn't apply to you or you can't answer it, just say "pass"


**Recording & Data Usage Statement**

We plan to record this interview solely for the purpose of creating accurate internal text notes to support the LORS report and standards development.

* **Objections:** If you prefer not to be recorded, please let us know in advance, and we will happily accommodate that.  
* **Privacy vs. Credit:** By default, we use insights for internal review. However, if you wish to be publicly acknowledged for your contribution to the standard, we would be delighted to credit you.  
* **Flexibility:** All terms regarding confidentiality and data usage are open for discussion to ensure your comfort.

## **Reviewing the Topics**

## Below is a menu of topics we might discuss. **You can answer these at varying levels of depth depending on your comfort and expertise.**

## Please look over this list. **If there are topics you do NOT want to discuss, or if you think we are missing something critical, let us know before we start.**

## ---

### **Phase 1: General Context**

## *Low technicality. Focus on your experience.*

1. **Your role & involvement:** What’s your role, and how do you interact with rover development (system, subsystem, integration, testing)? In broad terms, what kind of rover/mission are you working on?  
2. **Your War Stories:** In your last project, what was the single most frustrating integration problem? (e.g., "The release mechanism jammed," "The software driver took 3 weeks to write.")

3. ## **The "Wheel Reinvention":** What simplistic component did you have to design from scratch because you couldn't just buy it?

4. ## **Resource Sinks:** What "boring" part of the rover consumed the most unexpected budget or time?

### **Phase 2: Technical Deep Dives**

## *Higher technicality. We will focus on the area relevant to your role. You only need to answer for your domain.*

## **Option A**: Mechanical & Thermal

* ## **Mounting:** How do you decide where to bolt things down? Would a standard grid (like an optical breadboard) help or hurt?

* ## **Thermal:** Is thermal management (straps, heat pipes) always a custom design, or could standard interfaces save time?

* ## **Dust:** Is dust protection a unique problem for every single joint?

## **Option B**: Power & Electrical 

* ## **Connectors:** Do you struggle to find reliable connectors? What "standard plug" do you wish existed?

* ## **Power:** Do you build custom battery packs or buy them? What voltage standards do you rely on (28V, 12V)?

## **Option C**: Software & Avionics

* ## **Drivers:** How much custom code do you write just to connect new instruments?

* **Standards you use today:** What standards or de-facto conventions do you rely on (NASA/ESA/ECSS/ISO, ROS2, cFS, SpaceWire, CAN, Ethernet, custom ICDs)?

* ## **Integration:** If every sensor came with a standard driver, how much time would it save you?

**Option D:** Business & Program Management

* **Risks:** What is the biggest risk to your launch timeline right now? (e.g., supply chain, testing delays, regulatory approvals)  
* **Budget:** Which phase of the project always goes over budget?  
* **Hiring:** Is it hard to find engineers who know how to build these specific parts?  
* **Value:** Would you pay a premium for a "Certified Compatible" part if it saved you 3 months of integration and testing?

### **Phase 3: Closing**

1. ## **The Wish:** If you could snap your fingers and have one subsystem of the rover "just work" off-the-shelf, what would it be?

2. ## **Adoption:** What would convince you to use an external standard? (e.g., "It must be NASA certified," "It must be cheaper," "It must save me 2 months of testing.")

3. **Who else should we speak to?** Are there 1–2 people on your team or others you recommend we interview?

## **Preparation** 

## No preparation is required. You do not need to study. Just bring your honest experiences — especially the painful ones\!

## *We look forward to learning from you*
