# APEX 1.0 (ispace Mission 3)

Mission 3 is a milestone for both **ispace-U.S.** and the **NASA CLPS** program, representing the first commercial delivery to the lunar far side. Led by Draper as the prime contractor for the CP-12 task order, the mission utilizes the heavy-logistic **APEX 1.0** lander.

## Mission Details
*   **Lander:** [APEX 1.0](../landers/APEX_1.MD)
*   **Prime Contractor:** Draper
*   **Target Landing Site:** Schrödinger Basin (Far Side).
*   **Trajectory:** Low-energy "Long Trajectory" (~135+ day cruise).

## Connectivity (Far Side Relay)
Because the landing site is on the far side, the mission includes a dedicated communication infrastructure:
*   **Relay Satellites:** Deploys two satellites, **Alpine** and **Lupine**, into lunar orbit prior to the lander's descent.
*   **Data Link:** Established via the relay constellation to Earth-based stations (DSN).

## Payloads
### NASA CLPS (CP-12) Science
*   **Farside Seismic Suite (FSS):** Two seismometers (VBB and SP) to collect the first seismic data from the lunar far side.
*   **LITMS (Lunar Interior Temperature and Materials Suite):** A pneumatic drill and electrodes to measure heat flow and conductivity.
*   **LuSEE-Lite (Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment):** Characterizing the lunar ionospheric and electromagnetic environment.

### International & Commercial
*   **ispace-EUROPE Micro Rover:** A 5kg-class rover for regolith sampling and technology demonstration.
*   **LaRA2:** Laser Retroreflector Array from the Italian Space Agency (ASI).
*   **Relay Constellation:** Alpine & Lupine smallsats.

## Status
Planned for **2026** launch. Engineering review cycles are incorporating lessons learned from HAKUTO-R Mission 1 and Mission 2.
