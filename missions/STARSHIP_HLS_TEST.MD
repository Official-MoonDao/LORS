# Starship HLS Uncrewed Test

## Overview
A critical milestone for the Artemis program, this uncrewed demonstration mission involves launching a Starship HLS, refilling it in Earth orbit, and performing an autonomous landing on the lunar surface without a return phase.

## Mission Phases
1.  **Refilling Demo:** Multiple Starship tankers will launch and transfer propellant to the "Target" HLS in LEO.
2.  **Trans-Lunar Injection:** The refilled HLS will boost to lunar orbit.
3.  **Autonomous Landing:** Executes a precision landing at the lunar South Pole to validate the modified Raptor engines and landing gear.

## Technical Objectives
*   Validate the **5.8 GHz Wi-Fi** surface link for rover coordination.
*   Test the external radiators and solar arrays in the extreme lunar thermal environment.
*   Verify the BE-7 derived RCS (Reaction Control System) and Ka-Band landing radar.

## Status
Planned for late 2025 or early 2026, depending on Starship orbital flight test (OFT) cadence.
