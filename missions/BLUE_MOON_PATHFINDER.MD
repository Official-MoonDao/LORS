# Blue Moon Pathfinder

## Overview
The Blue Moon Pathfinder mission (MK1-SN001) is the first full-scale flight test of Blue Origin's Mark 1 lunar lander. It is designed to validate the BE-7 engine, cryogenic fluid systems, and precision landing tech required for the larger HLS Mark 2 missions.

## Mission Details
*   **Lander:** [Blue Moon MK1](../landers/BLUE_MOON_MK1.MD)
*   **Carrier:** New Glenn Launch Vehicle.
*   **Precision Landing:** Targeting accuracy within 100 meters using advanced lidar and vision-based navigation.
*   **Scientific Objectives:** Primarily focused on plume-surface interaction (PSI) studies.

## Primary Payloads
*   **SCALPSS (Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume-Surface Studies):** A NASA-funded camera suite to capture high-resolution imagery of the lander’s exhaust interacting with and ejecting lunar regolith.

## Connectivity
*   **Relay Node:** Establishes the "Pathfinder" communication node, proving continuous X-Band downlink capability for future Mark 1/2 commercial customers.

## Status
*   Scheduled for launch in early 2026 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.
