# Artemis III (HLS Segment)

## Overview
Artemis III is the historic mission to return humans to the lunar surface for the first time in over 50 years. SpaceX's Starship HLS will serve as the transportation vehicle from Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) to the lunar south pole.

## Mission Architecture
*   **Carrier:** SpaceX Starship HLS (Lander) matched with NASA's SLS/Orion (Crew Delivery).
*   **Crew:** 2 astronauts will descend to the surface (while 2 remain in Orion).
*   **Duration:** Approximately 7 days on the lunar surface.

## Connectivity & Navigation
*   **High-Bandwidth Link:** Utilizes Ka-Band for real-time video streaming to Earth and the Gateway.
*   **Proximity Comms:** 5.8 GHz Wi-Fi link for astronaut-to-lander and rover-to-lander high-rate data.
*   **Precision Navigation:** Uses Ka-Band radar and optical terrain relative navigation (TRN) to target safe landing zones in shadowed polar craters.

## LORS Involvement
*   **Rover Coordination:** Any LORS-standard scouting rovers deployed prior to or during Artemis III will utilize the Starship HLS as a high-speed data gateway.

## Status
Targeting September 2026 (NET).
